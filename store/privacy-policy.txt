Privacy Policy for JSON Spot

Last updated: February 6, 2026

JSON Spot is a browser extension that formats and beautifies JSON and XML content within web page elements. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles user data.

DATA COLLECTION

JSON Spot does not collect, store, or transmit any user data. The extension:

- Does NOT collect any personally identifiable information
- Does NOT track browsing history or activity
- Does NOT make any network requests
- Does NOT use analytics or telemetry
- Does NOT use cookies or local storage for tracking purposes

HOW THE EXTENSION WORKS

All processing happens entirely within your browser. When you format or minify JSON/XML content, the extension reads the text from the focused element, processes it locally using built-in JavaScript functions, and writes the formatted result back to the same element. No data ever leaves your browser.

The only browser storage used is chrome.storage.sync for saving your preferences (indentation setting and auto-detect toggle). These settings are synced through your Chrome profile, not through any third-party service.

PERMISSIONS

The extension requests the following permissions:

- contextMenus: To add "Format JSON / XML" and "Minify JSON / XML" to the right-click menu
- activeTab: To access the content of the currently active tab when you use the extension
- storage: To save your indentation and auto-detect preferences

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

JSON Spot does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services.

CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be published alongside the extension update.
